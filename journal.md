Today I made a rough BOM and understood how the printhead actually functions with all the fans, the extruder, and hotend, etc. I chose to make this bedslinger with lots of nice features that would make it rival my A1, which would be insanely helpful for printing a lot of stuff.

Also I designed the frame out of extrusions, looking sturdy so far.
