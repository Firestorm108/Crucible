Today I made a rough BOM and understood how the printhead actually functions with all the fans, the extruder, and hotend, etc. I chose to make this bedslinger with lots of nice features that would make it rival my A1, which would be insanely helpful for printing a lot of stuff.

Also I designed the frame out of extrusions, looking sturdy so far.

Today I started off with doing the y axis and adding a bit.

However the build was a bit too "noodly" as some of my peers said lol (as this is my first 3dp I had to learn about everything in a short amount of time)
So I buffed it up a lot. I added more brackets, extrusions, the whole works. I also did the z axis which was a pain and everything about this stressed me. It felt like the final day of Undercity,
struggling to get everything in especially since this is a design I'm super proud of.

After that, I designed the bed and toolhead. This was definitely the hardest part, as I didn't really know how a toolhead was supposed to be like. The toolhead looks pretty decent and I think it should function pretty decently. Overall, pretty hapy with the build but overall, pretty happy with the build but thereâ€™s still a lot to go. The wiring is gonna be actual pain, and I still have to figure out the wiring diagram. I'm kind of sad that I didn't get to the IR stuff I was originally gonna do, but it should be an easy upgrade later down the line.

After that, I finished the wiring diagram and got a really cool render of the 3d printer.
