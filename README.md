# Crucible

A speedy and reliable bedslinger 3D printer! It uses fast belts, dual z-axis motors, and a heated bed. It has a print bed of 220mmx220m, larger than the A1 mini and about the same size as an Ender 3!
I designed this because I've never really understood how 3d printers work from the toolend to the belt system. I wanted to know everything about the machine. Being an A1 user, I have the least experience with tinkering and actually getting to know the 3d printer, so I wanted to do the polar opposite and design one myself. Also, for time crunches it's great to have a second printer to get things done.
